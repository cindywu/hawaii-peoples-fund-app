`The People’s Fund is a nonprofit corporation, the primary purpose of which is to  stimulate and encourage the study and creation of effective solutions to the social, economic, housing, health and other problems confronting the Hawaiian society. Although the state and municipal governmental agencies as well as private agencies are attempting to cope with many of these problems, the daily demands upon their personnel and resources often preclude them from seeking and attempting creative and innovative solutions and projects to pressing short-term and long-term social problems and needs. Moreover, these agencies generally are unable to involve persons from the community in the solution of such problems.`,

`The People’s Fund will seek to contribute to the search for solutions to Hawaii’s social problems and at the same time attempt to generate public awareness and participation in their activities. The People’s Fund hopes to accomplish these general objectives by providing financial and technical assistance to persons and organizations engaged in constructive social change, establish and maintain a speakers bureau and information clearninghouse, undertake human resources development programs, sponsor research reports on contemporary social problems of Hawaii and generally increase public awareness of alternative ways to improve the quality of life in Hawaii.
